# leftovers_app

This is Noah Tager and Jake Vitale's application for Noah's clothing brand Leftovers. It contains a webstore, a lookbook and dressing room. In the dressing room, we only have the ability to try on the beanies implemented currently. The dressing room loads with a test image displayed, so take a new picture to start. Try to get your face from the shoulders up, with some room between the top of your head and the top of the screen. You want as much of your face as possible in the frame. Then drag the beanie onto the image, and the beanie will align itself with your head.
